I don't believe the CNN Poll that says that Biden has a 55% to 41% lead over Donald Trump nationally.

I don't believe that we're that stupid as a nation!

Donald Trump contemplates delivering a speech addressing the evils of racism. As a racist himself, unless he concludes the speech by resigning, I’m guessing it will be ineffective.

@Christi95126146 @BuboJane @BartleyTonya @realDonaldTrump The interviews I have seen past and present with Joe Biden show no compassion or empathy. I have seen this in Donald Trump. He truly wants his country to be the best. And there's reason this man dropped some advisors. They were corrupt. Simple.
